## Song Class

The Song class represents individual songs and provides methods to manage information about them, such as the song name, artist, and genre. It also includes functionality to keep track of the total number of songs created, unique genres, and unique artists.

# Overview

The `Song` class is a fundamental component for managing song data in applications that deal with music libraries, playlists, or any other song-related functionality. It encapsulates key attributes and methods to create, access, and manage song objects.

# Features

- Create new song instances with song name, artist, and genre.
- Access attributes of song instances, including name, artist, and genre.
- Keep track of the total number of songs created.
- Maintain lists of unique genres and artists.
- Track the count of songs for each genre and artist.

# Usage
